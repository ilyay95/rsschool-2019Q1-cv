                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                <p>The main goal is to get a job as a junior JavaScript developer.
                    In 2018, I graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and
                    lectronics (BSUIR) a degree in software engineering.. At university I studied different languages, such as VB, C ++, C #, assembler, Java, Ruby these were mainly educational projects, but some were made to order. During training, I realized that programming is what I want to do in life.
                    I hope that I will follow this path with dignity. </p>

                <h3>English level:</h3>
                <p> B1 <br> I studied at the gymnasium with a bias in English, where we were taught from grade 1. By grade 11, I had good conversational English. At university, we studied technical English in the first year. Since then, the language practice has decreased, mainly textbooks on documentation and programming. In the near future I plan to resume speaking English. But in any case, I love English.
