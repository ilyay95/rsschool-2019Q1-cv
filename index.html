        <p>B1  
                I studied at the gymnasium with a bias in English, where we were taught from grade 1. By grade 11, I had good conversational English. At university, we studied technical English in the first year. Since then, the language practice has decreased, mainly textbooks on documentation and programming. In the near future I plan to resume speaking English. But in any case, I love English.
